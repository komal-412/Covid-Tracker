                  COVID-19 can spread like wildfire and cause mass infection if proper precautionary steps are not taken. 
                  Hence, we have to break the chain and restrain the community transmission of this virus. 
                  <br/>And the best way to that is by quarantining yourselves within your houses. 
                  We suggest that for your safety and your community security, staying at home is the best way to do your part at the moment.
                 </p>
